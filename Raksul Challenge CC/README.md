# Code Review Challenge

An intern created the program found in `main.go` and is asking you to review their code.

1. Start by figuring out what the program does.

1. Review their code. Provide specific suggestions and feedback to help your teammate to
   improve their coding style and address any issues with their implementation.

1. Refactor / rewrite their code in the way _you_ believe it should be implemented.

# How to submit your code

1. Submit your code and review comments as a **secret Github gist**.

1. Do _NOT_ leave comments or questions in _this gist_.

1. Send a link to your gist to **a.digholm@raksul.com**
